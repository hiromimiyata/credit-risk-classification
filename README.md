Overview of the Analysis:
We are analyzing if the original data model or the resampled data model using the linear regression model is a good fit for building a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.
Results:

Original Data Model:

Accuracy Score: 95.2%
Precision Score (High-Risk Loans - Label 1): 85%
Recall Score (High-Risk Loans - Label 1): 91%

Resampled Data Model:

Accuracy Score: 99.4%
Precision Score (High-Risk Loans - Label 1): 84%
Recall Score (High-Risk Loans - Label 1): 99%

Summary:
Both original and resampled data models are good at predicting hte creditworthiness of customers. The resampled data model has a slightly better accuracy and recall score. The original data model has a higher precion score.
